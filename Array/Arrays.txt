Arrays: arrays are the data str which contain similar elements,means one particular type of data.(same data type collection).

syntax:
int arr[6]; will give have some garbage value when we declare it inside the main function.

when we declare it globally outside the main function then it willl store initially with 0 at all the values.
java:  int arr[] = new int[6]

Max size to define the array=10 to power 6 inside the main
and max size globally is 10 to power 7.

index strats from 0 and goes till size -1.

Memory in computer it gets stored randomly and makes a block like x and then x+1 x+2.......
